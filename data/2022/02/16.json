Officially supported downloads/distributions can be found at: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)\n\n#### Direct Download\n\nYou can download & install **`npm`** directly from [**npmjs**.com](https://npmjs.com/) using our custom `install.sh` script:\n\n```bash\ncurl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n#### Node Version Managers\n\nIf you're looking to manage multiple versions of **`node`** &/or **`npm`**, consider using a \"Node Version Manager\" such as:\n\n* [**`nvm`**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)\n* [**`nvs`**](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs)\n* [**`nave`**](https://github.com/isaacs/nave)\n* [**`n`**](https://github.com/tj/n)\n* [**`volta`**](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta)\n* [**`nodenv`**](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)\n* [**`asdf-nodejs`**](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs)\n* [**`nvm-windows`**](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\nnpm <command>\n```\n\n### Links & Resources\n\n* [**Documentation**](https://docs.npmjs.com/) - Official docs & how-tos for all things **npm**\n    * Note: you can also search docs locally with `npm help-search <query>`\n* [**Bug Tracker**](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues) - Search or submit bugs against the CLI\n* [**Roadmap**](https://github.com/npm/roadmap) - Track & follow along with our public roadmap\n* [**Feedback**](https://github.com/npm/feedback) - Contribute ideas & discussion around the npm registry, website & CLI\n* [**RFCs**](https://github.com/npm/rfcs) - Contribute ideas & specifications for the API/design of the npm CLI\n* [**Service Status**](https://status.npmjs.org/) - Monitor the current status & see incident reports for the website & registry\n* [**Project Status**](https://npm.github.io/statusboard/) - See the health of all our maintained OSS projects in one view\n* [**Events Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=npmjs.com_oonluqt8oftrt0vmgrfbg6q6go@group.calendar.google.com) - Keep track of our Open RFC calls, releases, meetups, conferences & more\n* [**Support**](https://www.npmjs.com/support) - Experiencing problems with the **npm** [website](https://npmjs.com) or [registry](https://registry.npmjs.org)? File a ticket [here](https://www.npmjs.com/support)\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\n* `npm` is configured to use the **npm Public Registry** at [https://registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) by default; Usage of this registry is subject to **Terms of Use** available at [https://npmjs.com/policies/terms](https://npmjs.com/policies/terms)\n* You can configure `npm` to use any other compatible registry you prefer. You can read more about configuring third-party registries [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/registry)\n\n### FAQ on Branding\n\n#### Is it \"npm\" or \"NPM\" or \"Npm\"?\n\n**`npm`** should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a location that is customarily all-capitals (ex. titles on `man` pages).\n\n#### Is \"npm\" an acronym for \"Node Package Manager\"?\n\nContrary to popular belief, **`npm`** **is not** in fact an acronym for \"Node Package Manager\"; It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for **\"npm is not an acronym\"** (if the project was named \"ninaa\", then it would be an acronym). The precursor to **`npm`** was actually a bash utility named **\"pm\"**, which was the shortform name of **\"pkgmakeinst\"** - a bash function that installed various things on various platforms. If **`npm`** were to ever have been considered an acronym, it would be as \"node pm\" or, potentially \"new pm\".\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","man":["man/man1/npm-access.1","man/man1/npm-adduser.1","man/man1/npm-audit.1","man/man1/npm-bin.1","man/man1/npm-bugs.1","man/man1/npm-cache.1","man/man1/npm-ci.1","man/man1/npm-completion.1","man/man1/npm-config.1","man/man1/npm-dedupe.1","man/man1/npm-deprecate.1","man/man1/npm-diff.1","man/man1/npm-dist-tag.1","man/man1/npm-docs.1","man/man1/npm-doctor.1","man/man1/npm-edit.1","man/man1/npm-exec.1","man/man1/npm-explain.1","man/man1/npm-explore.1","man/man1/npm-find-dupes.1","man/man1/npm-fund.1","man/man1/npm-help-search.1","man/man1/npm-help.1","man/man1/npm-hook.1","man/man1/npm-init.1","man/man1/npm-install-ci-test.1","man/man1/npm-install-test.1","man/man1/npm-install.1","man/man1/npm-link.1","man/man1/npm-logout.1","man/man1/npm-ls.1","man/man1/npm-org.1","man/man1/npm-outdated.1","man/man1/npm-owner.1","man/man1/npm-pack.1","man/man1/npm-ping.1","man/man1/npm-pkg.1","man/man1/npm-prefix.1","man/man1/npm-profile.1","man/man1/npm-prune.1","man/man1/npm-publish.1","man/man1/npm-rebuild.1","man/man1/npm-repo.1","man/man1/npm-restart.1","man/man1/npm-root.1","man/man1/npm-run-script.1","man/man1/npm-search.1","man/man1/npm-set-script.1","man/man1/npm-shrinkwrap.1","man/man1/npm-star.1","man/man1/npm-stars.1","man/man1/npm-start.1","man/man1/npm-stop.1","man/man1/npm-team.1","man/man1/npm-test.1","man/man1/npm-token.1","man/man1/npm-uninstall.1","man/man1/npm-unpublish.1","man/man1/npm-unstar.1","man/man1/npm-update.1","man/man1/npm-version.1","man/man1/npm-view.1","man/man1/npm-whoami.1","man/man1/npm.1","man/man1/npx.1","man/man5/folders.5","man/man5/install.5","man/man5/npm-shrinkwrap-json.5","man/man5/npmrc.5","man/man5/package-json.5","man/man5/package-lock-json.5","man/man7/config.7","man/man7/developers.7","man/man7/logging.7","man/man7/orgs.7","man/man7/registry.7","man/man7/removal.7","man/man7/scope.7","man/man7/scripts.7","man/man7/workspaces.7"],"gitHead":"20a981890ba96d946036419f0ac124fe598663b7","_id":"npm@8.5.0","_nodeVersion":"16.13.2","_npmVersion":"8.5.0","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-L0yvQ8xkkM78YSZfO634auG0n4SleCa536n1rJ2uYJn6rzqyXnm6DpS2eQIq2g6b2JsA2XdZO41wkZWpsHNCAQ==","shasum":"755b130c3dc7725b390faff53ae24cbf68a7e14c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-8.5.0.tgz","fileCount":1926,"unpackedSize":8802639,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN
